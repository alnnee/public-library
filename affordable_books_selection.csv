The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.",English,9.78044E+12,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Action']","['Katniss Everdeen', 'Peeta Mellark', 'Cato (Hunger Games)', 'Primrose Everdeen', 'Gale Hawthorne', 'Effie Trinket', 'Haymitch Abernathy', 'Cinna', 'President Coriolanus Snow', 'Rue', 'Flavius', 'Lavinia (Hunger Games)', 'Marvel', 'Glimmer', 'Clove', 'Foxface', 'Thresh', 'Greasy Sae', 'Madge Undersee', 'Caesar Flickerman', 'Claudius Templesmith', 'Octavia (Hunger Games)', 'Portia (hunger Games)']",Hardcover,First Edition,374,Scholastic Press,09/14/08,,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Young Adult Book (2009)', 'Georgia Peach Book Award (2009)', 'Buxtehuder Bulle (2009)', 'Golden Duck Award for Young Adult (Hal Clement Award) (2009)', ""Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire Nominee for Roman jeunesse étranger (2010)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2012)', ""West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA) for Older Readers (2010)"", ""Red House Children's Book Award for Older Readers & Overall (2010)"", 'South Carolina Book Award for Junior and Young Adult Book (2011)', 'Charlotte Award (2010)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2010)', 'Teen Buckeye Book Award (2009)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award for Young Adults (2010)"", 'Rhode Island Teen Book Award (2010)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (2010)"", 'Evergreen Teen Book Award (2011)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2009)', 'Milwaukee County Teen Book Award Nominee (2010)', 'Sakura Medal for Middle School Book (2010)', 'Michigan Library Association Thumbs Up!

2998.The_Secret_Garden,The Secret Garden,,Frances Hodgson Burnett,4.13,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.A GAME OF THRONESLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.source: georgerrmartin.com",English,9.78055E+12,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Dragons', 'Audiobook', 'Epic']","['Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Tyrion Lannister', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Eddard Stark', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Robb Stark', 'Arya Stark', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Varys', 'Hodor', 'Beric Dondarrion', 'Thoros of Myr', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Grenn', 'Mace Tyrell', 'Septa Mordane', 'Jon Snow', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Jorah Mormont']",Mass Market Paperback,,835,Bantam,08/28/05,08/06/96,"['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1997)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Premio Ignotus for Novela extranjera (2003)']",2003043,"['1231600', '540493', '156705', '41880', '32365']",96,['The Lands of Ice and Fire'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496.jpg,562241,6007,4.01

39988.Matilda,Matilda,,"Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake (Illustrator)",4.32,"Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth.

A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem.

""I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers."" January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb...As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.",English,9.78198E+12,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'World War II', 'Book Club', 'War', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Books About Books']","['Sophie Kintock', 'Juliet Ashton', 'Dawsey Adams', 'Susan Scott', 'Sidney Stark', 'Elizabeth McKenna', 'Isola Pribby', 'Markham V.

Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",English,9.7814E+12,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Japan', 'Fantasy', 'Japanese Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia']","['Kafka Tamura', 'Sakura', 'Satoru Nakata', 'Oshima', 'Miss Saeki', 'Hoshino']",Paperback,,467,Vintage International,2001/3/6,10/28/02,"['World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2006)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2005)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2006)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Philip Gabriel (2006)', 'Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Nominee for Preis der Jugendjury (2005)', 'Tähtifantasia Award (2010)', 'Βραβείο Βιβλίου Public for Μεταφρασμένο μυθιστόρημα της χρονιάς (Translator: Αργυρώ Μαντόγλου) (2016)']",305688,"['125586', '116603', '46868', '12046', '4585']",95,['Takamatsu (Japan)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429638085l/4929.jpg,41731,474,8.22

I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.You may have heard of me.So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.",English,9.78076E+12,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Epic']","['Bast', 'Denna', 'Ambrose', 'Kvothe', 'Simmon', 'Wilem', 'The Chandrian', 'Maer Alveron', 'Felurian', 'Devi', 'Tempi', 'Auri', 'Fela', 'Chronicler']",Hardcover,First Edition,994,DAW Books,2003/1/11,,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2012)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2012)', 'Tähtifantasia Award Nominee (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Fantasy and for Favorite Book (2011)', 'Prix Elbakin.net for Meilleur roman fantasy traduit (2013)']",427730,"['289930', '99533', '27990', '7009', '3268']",98,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452624392l/1215032.jpg,40195,443,16.37

But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her ""gift"" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart.Beginning at the ""other"" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.",English,9.78142E+12,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Greek Mythology', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","['Nico di Angelo', 'Octavian', 'Hera', 'Reyna', 'Juno', 'Hazel Levesque', 'Frank Zhang', 'Ella the Harpy', 'Percy Jackson']",Hardcover,First Edition,513,Disney ● Hyperion Books,2010/4/11,,"[""Buckeye Children's Book Award for 6-8 (2012)"", ""Goodreads Choice Award for Middle Grade & Children's and Nominee for Favorite Book (2011)""]",412823,"['239125', '124167', '40367', '6527', '2637']",98,"['Oakland, California (United States)', 'Alaska (United States)', 'Portland, Oregon (United States)', 'Seattle, Washington (United States)', 'Berkeley, California (United States)', 'North Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada)', 'Anchorage, Alaska (United States)', 'Seward, Alaska (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464201114l/9520360._SY475_.jpg,37699,476,6.42

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flap",English,9.78014E+12,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'Adult']","['Mr. Edwards', 'Ethel', 'Lee', 'Faye', 'Tom Hamilton', 'Cyrus Trask', 'Mrs. Trask', 'Alice Trask', 'Adam Trask', 'Charles Trask', 'Aron Trask', 'Caleb Trask', 'Samuel Hamilton', 'Liza Hamilton', 'George Hamilton', 'Will Hamilton', 'Joe Hamilton', 'Lizzie Hamilton', 'Una Hamilton', 'Dessie Hamilton', 'Olive Hamilton', 'Mollie Hamilton', 'Cathy Ames', 'Abra Bacon', 'Joe Valery']",Paperback,Steinbeck Centennial Edition (US / CAN),601,Penguin Books,10/28/02,10/28/52,"['Audie Award for Classic (2004)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1953)']",428907,"['246230', '119358', '46605', '11428', '5286']",96,['California (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544744853l/4406.jpg,28764,344,5.26

  In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.
On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",English,9.7814E+12,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']","['Louie Zamperini', 'Russell Allen Phillips', 'Pete Zamperini', 'Stanley Pillsbury', 'Harry Brooks', 'Payton Jordan', 'Anthony Zamperini', 'Louise Zamperini', 'Francis McNamara (Mac)', 'William Harris', 'Fred Garrett', 'Frank Tinker', 'Thorbjørn Christiansen', 'Sylvia Zamperini Flammer', 'Virginia Zamperini', 'Lynn Moody', 'Cecy Perry', 'Cynthia Zamperini (Applewhite)', 'Harry Read', 'Yukichi Kano']",Hardcover,,492,Random House,11/16/10,,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (2010)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Young Adults (2014)"", 'Indies Choice Book Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for NonFiction (2011)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2015)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)']",767063,"['452057', '202821', '71163', '21654', '19368']",95,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115l/8664353.jpg,24200,290,1.15

But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.",English,9.78055E+12,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'History', 'Astronomy', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'Audiobook']",[],Paperback,Updated & Expanded 10th Anniversary,212,Bantam Books,09/01/98,04/01/88,['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee for General Prize (1989)'],303285,"['132545', '111195', '45287', '9312', '4946']",95,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578746l/3869.jpg,12369,175,2.72

She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gaëtan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

33917.The_Namesake,The Namesake,,Jhumpa Lahiri,4,"Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.In The Namesake, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.",English,9.78062E+12,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Indian Literature', 'Literature', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']","['Ashoke Ganguli', 'Ashima Ganguli', 'Gogol/Nikhil Ganguli', 'Sonia/Sonali Ganguli', 'Maxine', 'Moushumi Mazoomdar']",Paperback,,291,Mariner Books,2009/1/4,10/28/03,"['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2004)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2003)']",233553,"['75016', '97171', '48996', '10027', '2343']",95,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986l/33917._SY475_.jpg,9816,140,3.19

Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.",English,9.78074E+12,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'School']","['Jeannette Walls', 'Rex Walls', 'Rose Mary Walls', 'Maureen Walls', 'Brian Walls', 'Lori Walls']",Paperback,,288,Scribner,January 17th 2006,03/28/05,"['ALA Alex Award (2006)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2008)']",903463,"['445108', '310999', '110694', '25026', '11636']",96,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'West Virginia (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SY475_.jpg,8539,109,2.87

Soon Thibault experiences a sudden streak of luck—winning poker games and even surviving deadly combat that kills two of his closest buddies. Only his best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph—his lucky charm.Back home in Colorado, Thibault can’t seem to get the photo—and the woman in it—out of his mind.

The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",English,9.7804E+12,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']",[],Hardcover,,334,Random House,February 20th 2018,,"['Audie Award for Best Female Narrator (2019)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Biography (2018)', 'ALA Alex Award (2019)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Longlist (2019)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)', 'PEN/Jean Stein Book Award Nominee for Shortlist (2019)', 'Reading Women Award for Nonfiction (2018)']",796019,"['477689', '236894', '62027', '12742', '6667']",98,"['Idaho Mountains (United States)', 'Idaho (United States)', 'Arizona (United States)', 'Rome (Italy)', 'Paris (France)', 'Palmyra, New York (United States)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Cambridge, England (United Kingdom)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg,3826,42,5.42

He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock.

Readers and critics were enchanted; as NPR commented, “Towles writes with grace and verve about the mores and manners of a society on the cusp of radical change.”A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with the story of Count Alexander Rostov. When, in 1922, he is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the count is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him a doorway into a much larger world of emotional discovery.Brimming with humour, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavour to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.",English,9.78014E+12,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']","['Count Alexander Rostov', 'Mikhail Fyodorovich Mindich', 'Anna Urbanova', 'Nina Kulikova', 'Sofia Kulikova']",Paperback,,462,Penguin Books,March 26th 2019,2009/6/16,"['Kirkus Prize Nominee for Fiction (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2016)', 'Book of the Month Book of the Year Award Nominee (2016)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2018)']",293330,"['161425', '87671', '31051', '8990', '4193']",96,"['Hotel Metropol, Moscow (Russian Federation)', 'Moscow (Russian Federation)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1551480896l/34066798._SY475_.jpg,2401,27,6.29
25489625-between-the-world-and-me,Between the World and Me,,Ta-Nehisi Coates,4.39,"“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son.

12609433-the-power-of-habit,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,,Charles Duhigg (Goodreads Author),4.1,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.",English,9.7814E+12,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Sociology']",[],Hardcover,,375,Random House,February 28th 2012,,"['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)']",343452,"['137742', '128611', '58483', '12468', '6148']",95,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545854312l/12609433._SY475_.jpg,1320,15,7.86

Their stories cross continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.",English,9.7811E+12,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'War', 'Holocaust', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction']","['Caroline Ferriday', 'Kasia Kuzmerick', 'Herta Oberheuser', 'Paul Rodierre']",Hardcover,,487,Ballantine Books,April 5th 2016,,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction & for Debut Goodreads Author (2016)'],213160,"['100414', '81001', '24439', '4929', '2377']",97,"['New York State (United States)', 'Paris (France)', 'Germany', 'Lublin (Poland)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462850258l/25893693.jpg,473,5,4.6

Before the Heralds abandoned us and the Knights Radiant turned against us. When there was still magic in Roshar and honor in the hearts of men.In the end, not war but victory proved the greater test. Did our foes see that the harder they fought, the fiercer our resistance? Fire and hammer forge a sword; time and neglect rust it away. So we won the world, yet lost it.Now there are four whom we watch: the surgeon, forced to forsake healing and fight in the most brutal war of our time; the assassin, who weeps as he kills; the liar, who wears her scholar's mantle over a thief's heart; and the prince, whose eyes open to the ancient past as his thirst for battle wanes.
